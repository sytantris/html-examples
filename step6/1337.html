Hello you. If you completed this exercise, you are truly the leetest of hackers.

As if the uppercase wasn't obnoxious enough....

Seriously though, good show. Hopefully now you are feeling just dandy about callbacks.
Well, maybe not dandy. /giphy reluctant acceptance ...maybe? ;)

Oh wait, I forgot I'm supposed to be speaking leet.
It feels weird even typing 'leet' with letters. But how else will you know if...
                                                               IT WORKED????????


Anyway, just to make this feel like you're an authentic hacker from 1998....


"What do you want to do, fool?"
"I do not know, do you want to play a game of Quake 3?"
"No, I think I would rather nuke some users on IRC."
"But I'm a grey hat hacker. I only nuke in ethical circumstances."
"Well then, I guess we can DDoS some ports and ping some localhosts!"
"That sounds leet. Do you want to use my Amiga?"
"We could, but my 486 is so three years ago."
"I do like Windows 3.1!"

    ~ and then they ended up playing 26 consecutive rounds of Minesweeper. ~
                      ~ and nary a localhost was pinged. ~
                                  ~ the end ~

                        Make sure you commit before you start the next exercise!
