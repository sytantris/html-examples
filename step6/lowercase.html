                       Ode to Web Design in 1996

Oh, the way we used to mix our structure, content and our styles
For many a year, nary a CSS file to be found
                                    Indeed - I wrote many websites as a teenager
                                           And I did not even know what CSS was.

But HTML, I adopted with reckless abandon
      And in those days, we did not care, if your tags were UPPER or lower case.
Whether you delimited your attributes with quotes
You could be as inconsistent as the day was long, and still call yourself


                         A WebMaster


                         Your hit counter and guestbook told you the real truths
                                            As did the webrings you belonged to.

Crossing your fingers as you made a Geocities account
Hoping to get Tokyo/Towers and a good number...

                       You added your Scrolling Marquee,
                      That's all Javascript seemed to be,
             A source of rainbow detritus and alerts about Viagra.

Little did I know I would write it
                            with the swiftness
                                    of brazen fingers
                                            gliding over molten silk
                                     today

                           On the server side, even!

                                                       My home server was Apache
                                 And no, I did not really know what it was doing

                                                     But it had some PHP
                                                     Sadly, no /cgi-bin...

                                       Instead, folders upon folders of websites
                          Forever 'Under Construction'


And speak I must of the HTML
          So ragged in its infancy
                  As we rendered it in The Netscape Navigator


Do you remember ＜font＞ tags?
                          Do you remember ＜center＞?
                                              Do you remember ＜table＞ layouts?


Do you remember Microsoft Frontpage?
With all of its repetitive inline styles it appended,
What a behemoth it was.

                            You could even write a webpage in Microsoft Word....
                              Ah, the glory days.


             ＜br＞＜br＞＜br＞＜br＞＜br＞＜br＞＜br＞＜br＞＜br＞


          Red on Blue text,
                                                           Neon Green.
          Comic Sans,
                                                        Animated GIFs.
                              Not like Giphy, no.
                             Not reaction GIFs, no.

                            We had dancing hamsters,
                                   Clip art.

                                                      HTML Chat Rooms.
                                             We had no AJAX,

                         You hit refresh to truly ~see~
                   [Computers only did what you told them to]

                                 Except when you downloaded 'COOLDOGPIC.JPG.EXE'
                                                 From a seemingly friendly email
                                                             And you got a virus
                                             And you had to take the computer in
                                                     Much to your mom's chagrin.

Now, it is she you must warn,
As your developer skills blossom,

                                     HARK!
                                      NO!

                      Do not open that email from Paypal,
                        Don't you see the URL is shady?
