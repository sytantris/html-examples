Nicely done. Now you should be seeing a neatly formatted HTML document,
not a crazy deluge of random chunks.
All hail the great +=! (or push, if you used an array...)

But we can still do better. This function is not modular.

In the next exercise, we'll pass the requestOptions as a param to the function,
so the function can be reused for different URLs.

Make sure you commit before you start the next Step!
