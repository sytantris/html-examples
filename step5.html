Yay, now your function is nested happily in its own little module, and as such,
it is completely modular. You could require this module in all sorts of files,
and tell it to do all sorts of crazy wild unimaginable things.

Or, the slightly less crazy, not exactly wild, and entirely imaginable things
we'll be doing (but gotta hype it up, right?) now that we have this cool module
we can require.

Make sure you commit before you start the next Step!
